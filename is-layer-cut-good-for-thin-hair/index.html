            </p><p>.at the risk of sounding like a complete idiot, is there any real difference between the 'npc' dangoro model, and the 'boss' dangoro model? Looks like we are getting some updated model rips for this game, fixing some of the models. I imported the model in roblox studio and it worked well with the only problem being the textures were all messed up, to describe it mario was completely white, still had the buttons on his shirt. New donk city hall model paper lantern pauline statue peach's castle model plush frog potted palm tree rock fragment @ravenclawnimbus, @walmurs1 the improved genshin impact model ripping tutorial is now complete, i have pm'd it to both of you. I think it does because any time someone does a model swap mod, the title screen model (s) also change.
