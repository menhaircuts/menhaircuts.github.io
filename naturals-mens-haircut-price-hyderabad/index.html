            </p><p>The cpu isn't actually stuck at 64c, hwinfo shows normal temps and i can feel from the exhaust that it's idling at normal temps. I've searched for power management setups in the bios and couldn't find much. Hello my cpu temp is goin 90 to 100 degrees while gaming and without gaming its temp are 45 to 50. Ryzen 3900x so basically im seeing the cpu temp jump around 45c to as high as 70c. Is there any fix for this? I checked the core usage and the last two cores (22 and 23) seem to be the ones spiking the most consistently. Cpu temperature is instead a single measurement centered on the external surface of the cpus case or ihs (i ntegrated h eat s preader) where the cooler is seated. (when installing something 'heavy' they might be on the higher temps for a few seconds more than on.</p>

        <p>For some reason its readings on the cpu temp will get stuck and the only way i can fix it is by uninstalling and reinstalling msi center. The idle temp is around 50°c and this results in random cpu fan spikes that i don&#039;t mind when i&#039;m doing something requiring intensive power but not so much when i&#039;m just browsing the web. Its like its doing something in the background but im not sure what that would be.</p>

        <p>Cpu temperature is instead a single measurement centered on the external surface of the cpus case or ihs (i ntegrated h eat s preader) where the cooler is seated. Do i need to pay more attention to one over the other? Core temp is a compact, no fuss, small footprint, yet powerful program to monitor processor temperature and other vital information.</p>

        <p>I just checked the temperature in the bios when coretemp and hwmonitor were reading fluctuations between 60 and 95 degrees, and it read the cpu temp as 46 degrees with pch temp at 53 degrees and a motherboard temp of 34 degrees. And this high cpu temps are harmful for other components as well like ram and gpu?</p>

        <p>Do i need to pay more attention to one over the other? For some reason its readings on the cpu temp will get stuck and the only way i can fix it is by uninstalling and reinstalling msi center. I just checked the temperature in the bios when coretemp and hwmonitor were reading fluctuations between 60 and 95 degrees, and it read the cpu temp as 46 degrees with pch temp at 53 degrees and a motherboard temp of 34 degrees.</p>

        <p>Core temp is a compact, no fuss, small footprint, yet powerful program to monitor processor temperature and other vital information. Is there any fix for this?</p>
