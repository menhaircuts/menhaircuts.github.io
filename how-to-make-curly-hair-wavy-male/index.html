        <p>For variable assignment in make, i see := and = operator. Rather than create 2 temporary dfs you can just pass these as params within a dict using the dataframe constructor: Make is a gnu command so the only way you can get it on windows is installing a windows version like the one provided by gnuwin32.</p>
