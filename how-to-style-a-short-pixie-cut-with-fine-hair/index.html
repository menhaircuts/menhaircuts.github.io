        <p>Corey seager only had to do it in 7 because of the expanded playoffs. After a slew of abysmal performances since the start of the new year, reggie finally bounced back with two great performances on 1/17 and yesterday (28 pts / 3 reb / 12 ast / 0 stl / 0 blk /2 to). So tobias might benefit from reggie being out there somewhat and his ability to spread the court, but i still think his value will decrease upon jackson's return.</p>

        <p>Isn&#039;t it weird that reggie jackson is still the leader in striking out? In 1977, the center of his career, pitchers struck out 5.0 per 9, compared to 8.7 in 2023 and getting as high as 9.1 in some seasons. Foxx is the only one that strikes me as particularly popular the last several years.</p>
