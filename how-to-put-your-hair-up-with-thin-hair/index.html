Dear lucie bonneau thank you for posting to microsoft community based on your description, i understand that your hotmail has been hacked, please point out if my understanding is wrong.

Don't worry, i will do everything i can to help you get back your hacked hotmail account. My hotmail account has recently been locked and i'm unable to log back in.</p>
