            </p><p>Fairly curly hair is less curly than curly hair, so which attribute is lessened is defined by the placement of fairly. Long, brown, straight hair also sounds ordinary to me. When i went downstairs this morning, i found some hair/hairs on the sofa, where my cat had been sleeping. I find that chart interesting.  i will get my hair cut today. the above sentences are both correct grammatically? I would be just as likely to say the adjectives for hair in almost any order: Unless you are talking about specific strands of hair (as in she left a few long hairs in the back) we use the singular. I always start my adjective list with the most notable trait.</p>

        <p>If speakers felt the need to mention the tool, then they&#039;d probably change the verb for a more generic one, like passar. I comb my hair with a comb = em pentino els cabells amb una pinta these sentences, though, sound very redundant in catalan. Greetings, do i stand corrected if i say that:</p>

        <p>It depends on whether you regard the hairs individually or as a group. Em passo el raspall pels cabells em passo la pinta pels cabells Is it ok to rustle one's hair (or someone else's)?</p>

        <p>I would be just as likely to say the adjectives for hair in almost any order: Here some hairs refers to a small number of hairs, which can also be expressed by some hair.  i will get my hair cut today. the above sentences are both correct grammatically?</p>

        <p>I rustle my hair, trying to dry it. If straight was the characteristic of that hair that seemed most remarkable to the speaker, it would be normal to place that adjective right before the noun hair. For curly, kinky, wavy and coily hair textures.</p>
