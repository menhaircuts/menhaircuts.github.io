            </p><p>My hair are too curly. It depends on whether you regard the hairs individually or as a group. I comb my hair with a comb = em pentino els cabells amb una pinta these sentences, though, sound very redundant in catalan. I haven't seen this construction before. Fairly curly hair is less curly than curly hair, so which attribute is lessened is defined by the placement of fairly. Greetings, do i stand corrected if i say that: Is it ok to rustle one's hair (or someone else's)? Does my hair look good?</p>

        <p>If speakers felt the need to mention the tool, then they&#039;d probably change the verb for a more generic one, like passar. Here some hairs refers to a small number of hairs, which can also be expressed by some hair. For curly, kinky, wavy and coily hair textures.</p>

        <p>For curly, kinky, wavy and coily hair textures. Hi, i was reading a short story in the american literary magazine ruminate, and found the following sentence: Long, brown, straight hair also sounds ordinary to me.</p>
