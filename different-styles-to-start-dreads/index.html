            </p><p>I wanted an answer to a simple question about dedicated vpns, nothing but sponsored ads, and then more ads below that. It's been this way since at least tuesday for me. I've seen a bunch of people say they had to use the bing home page, other's said the edge new tab page worked for them. I can say that for me, i was able to get it to work on. I never realized how handy and useful it was to my quality of life. Will msedge allow user to get rid of trending now keyword and default bing search engine on newtab page? It follows my account to different pcs now. It only happens on one pc.</p>
