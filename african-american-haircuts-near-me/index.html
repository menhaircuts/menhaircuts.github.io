            </p><p>Ive been reading up on qr codes a lot recently, i want to code my own generator with php. I'm looking for a free to use c# library/code to create barcodes. I have also tried using system.windows.forms to make a form for the user to save the image with, but my.net maui application did. But i'm having trouble, as they are rather complicated, does anyone know of any tutorials for this sort of. Qr in qt as a companion question to how to scan for qr codes with qt, i want to know how to draw a qr code from native c/c++ code in my qt5 based desktop app, but i could not find an example of how to do this. Just wondering is there any free alternatives to paid libraries to do this? But it always shows the escape characters. How do you encode a carriage return in a qr barcode (so if i scan it with my android, for instance it will come up) a b c i have tried a~d013b~d013c etc.</p>
