            </p><p>Hey, i loathe facebook, don't have an account with the scumbags, but occasionally, i need to visit a page for some information. Check your notifications on another device. Waiting for approval it may take a few minutes to get the notification on your other device. The only way i can log into is by resetting my password, but changing password every time is problematic and since god knows when facebook disables my account. The password is not working. Is anyone else constantly getting login alerts? As soon as i start scrolling, the page freezes and a modal dialog pops up forcing me to log in, preventing further access to the content. Whenever i try to log in onto facebook, it says wrong password.</p>

        <p>The password is not working. Then you have to go back to the mcdonald app and login via facebook and when the pop up opens, make sure to select “edit what i share” or something like this and make sure to untick the email. I keep getting them even though i use the same phone and location doesn&#039;t change.</p>
