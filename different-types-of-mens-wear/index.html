            </p><p>What platform was this on?? I googled the venmo/zelle scam and had some ideas about the scam and the typical signs of scammer, i.e. Facebook marketplace is by far the best option where i live. Facebook marketplace, when is it ok to accept venmo/zelle? I'm looking everywhere and cannot seem to find a way to view my own posts on facebook marketplace. Mark as sold = one item mark as out of stock = a listing with multiple items in stock however, facebook can glitch and think you have multiple in stock if you selected multiple. Facebook recently launched a slightly better, and certainly more prominent, marketplace to sell goods locally. If it looks like a new profile, not much on it, seems like a fake profile to me.</p>
