My problem was make was trying to run a cmd i didn't have (numactl in my particular case). I'm trying to create a virtual environment. 'make' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file to be specific, i open the command window, cd to the folder where i saved the. Problem i wanted to use a makefile with the command make for more complex compilations of my.c files, but it doesn't seem to recognize the command make no matter. I can run gcc from mingw64 shell, but not make. Rather than create 2 temporary dfs you can just pass these as params within a dict using the dataframe constructor:</p>
