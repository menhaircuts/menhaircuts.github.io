I was just checking my exoerian report and on their main website they have listed a warning regarding fraudulent emails claiming to be from experian. How can i speak to a human at experian?! I called experian and their system told me that my account freeze is still active, so i didn't image all of this. Then new dispute, account or other information, then inquiry. Not sure if it was experian or one of the other 3 but i remember it would say it was sending the text but it wouldnt actually send the text until i asked for the code to resend. I don't exactly remember when it last changed but looking further it says daily. My experian score is excellent, equifax and transunion poor (waiting for negatives to fall.</p>
