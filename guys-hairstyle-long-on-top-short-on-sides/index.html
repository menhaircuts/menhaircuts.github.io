        <p>I play pc bedrock, i was playing my multiplayer world and my friend informed me he couldn&#039;t join cause the game said i was in the older version, i update my game on the xbox app and reopened minecraft after doing so it had me sign into my account i signed into the same account as before, only this time all of my worlds were gone. So i wanted to sign out of my account on bedrock, let&#039;s call this account 1, but i went into settings and the sign out button was missing. What else can i do to fix this?</p>
